# BPMN Self-Review

This BPMN process guides you through a BPMN Self-Review. Deploy and start a process instance on a dev cluster, and navigate to tasklist to start the review process.

You will start with a self-assessment of your BPMN files, following various BPMN examples presented in a form. Depending on your assessment, you will be guided through each aspect your BPMN files could be improved on.

# Installation Guide

There are no external dependencies. Simply add the BPMN file to your Web Modeler, or directly deploy it to a dev cluster. There is no need to run this in a production cluster.
